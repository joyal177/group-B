Dashain is the longest and the most important 
festival of

Nepal. Generally Dashain falls in late September to mid October, right

after the monsoon season in Nepal.
 Dashain gets many

different nick names as Dasara, Bada Dashain, Vijaya Dashain,

Durga Puja, all of which mean the 
same thing, Dashain, a day

of Victory over Demons.</p>



<p align="justify">According to the legend, the bloodthirsty



Goddess, Durga conquered evils on the Dashain day. Huge

amount of animal sacrifices take place during the festival in


temples and in home to please the Goddess Durga. Some people may take such animal sacrifices 

negatively but they might forget
 how they came by their 
meat on their plate! There are lots of western countries consuming mass amount of meat, animals are 

slaughtered in factories
 by the hundreds and thousands.
 The final day of the festival is known as <i>`Tika'</i>, a day on which

the elder ones give <i>`Tika'</i> to the younger ones
 and to

other relatives who come for their blessings.</font></p>

<p><b>
 for the followings :</b></p>

<ul>

<li><b>Holidays</b> - Rest and Relaxation for nearly 10 days!<br>
 This is the longest festival in Nepal. It allows one to travel and be with family and friends for upto a week or more.
</li>

<li><b>Shopping</b> - Clothes for wife, children, dad, mum, and all except you! 

In spite of extreme
 hardship, during the festival season, Nepalese families manage to shop if not for all, but at least for the children. 


Clothes are the most selling item during the season.

Those who could not afford to wear even a single new cloth in 
the entire year will now attempt!
</li>

<li><b>Dashain Bonus</b> - Nepali Government gives Bonus to government workers as a Dashain bonus (Usually 
equals
to one's monthly salary). Some private companies such as Banks do the same. Farmers earn their bonus by selling their highly
 demand
ed agriculture and live-stock products in return for a good cash</li> 

<li><b>Eating</b> - Meat Products, Sweets, Fruits
 and meat products again!. 

Dashain's most popular cuisine is meat, and in popularity order are goat meat, sheep, buffalo, 
duck, and chicken. Meat is expensive and poor to middle class families usually can not afford it. 

So dashain is the time of
 eating lots of meat. 

Usually animals are bought live from the animal market such as Kalanki Bazaar, Bag Bazaar,  and 
sacrificed at home or in temples.

At home, the whole family is involved in cutting and preparing the meat which usually 
lasts for 2 to 3 day's of feast. But some family prefer to buy the meat already prepared by Butchers</li>

<li><b>Visiting
</b> - Meet your Family and Friends near and far<br>

Dashain is also about forgiveness, kindness and respect, all 
of which prevails so broken families come together.

Cities suddenly seems to empty itself, more people returning back
 in villages or <i>terai</i> (lower, flat region of Nepal) than that of people joining families in cities. During this season,
 city rushes to book tickets, bus or plane!</li>

<li><b>Kites</b> - Children love the season also for flying Kites
<br>

If you visit Kathmandu or any other city during this season, the day-sky is filled with colorful kites like
 shinning stars in the night!</li>

<li><b>Tika and Love</b> - Receiving and Giving <i>Tika</i> and Respect.
<br>

Getting a tika from an older person in your family or from relatives or from anyone is a blessing.  


Dashain tika begins from the oldest person in your family giving tika to the youngest then the second youngest 
in the family and so on. 

Faith, hope, inspiration and blessings, all come alive in Dashain.</li>

<li><b>
Money Notes</b> - stacks of notes to give!<br>

Receive a tika and offer money notes as an appreciation. 
Popular Dashain notes are Rupees 2, 5, 10, and Rupees 25.

Everybody tries to exchange for smaller and new
 notes, so banks are usually busy during the season.</li>   

<li><b>Cleaning</b> - Clean and decorate homes
<br>

Walls get a new coat of paints, roads are cleaned better than before, temples are decorated with lights,
 

villagers join together to clean and build new trails, paint their homes using red-colored mud. People clean
 themselves mentally too by visiting various temples and worshiping during the festival.</li>

<li><b>Puja</b>

 - Worshiping God for Peace and Prosperity<br></li>

Various pujas are performed from beginning to the end 
of Dashain.

<li><b>Gambling</b> - although not legal in Nepal, but it's played!<br></li>

Playing cards are
 popular during Dashain. Usually family members play cards with each-other or with friends for money. 

<li><b>

</p><p align="justify"><b>1st Dashain Day

(Pot Day) :</b> In the evening or at the time announced

by Astrologers, a clay pot is filled with a mixture of sand

and soil and Barley seeds are sown after performing Puja

(Worshiping God). The pot is kept isolated from sun-light and

a Puja is performed on it every evening till the last day of

Dashain. On the last day, the yellow leaves (seedlings) are

collected from the pot and are placed at the back of ear or

hooked in hairs after Tika (a colored rice or color powder

placed in one's forehead as a blessing from God). The tiny yellow leaves are
 called <i>Jamara</i> in Nepali. The first

nine days of Dashain are called NavaRatri. <em>Nava</em>

means nine and 
<em>Ratri</em> means Night. Some also call

Dashain as NavaRatri. So <b>Ghatas Thapana </b>is the first day in Dashain
 that triggers the beginning of the festival, it is this day which tells us that Dashain has just begun!</p>



<p align="justify">
<b>7th Dashain Day:</b> This day is known as Fulpati. On this

day, Jamara (tiny yellow sprouts of crops such as barley)  
for Royal families carried from their ancestral

Royal Gorkha
 palace arrives at Rani

Pokhari Kathmandu and in the evening they are taken to Royal

Palace along with a huge parade.
 For more on how Jamaras are made see the 1st day of Dashain above</p>

<p></p>

<p align="justify"><b>8th 
Dashain Day :</b> Maha (Big) Asthami (Eight). Here is a

Big Eight Day of Dashain full of sacrifices of blood to Durga

and Kali Goddess. The night of this day is called Kal Ratri,

the night is dark and the blood thirsty Kali Goddess along

with Durga receive huge sacrifices in

Kathmandu and in many parts of Nepal. In the capital, the most bloody

animal sacrifices in this dark night takes place at the Basantapur

Hanuman Dhoka</p>

<p></p>

<p align="justify"><b>9th Dashain Day :</b> This is the Nawami (Ninth) day, a day before the real dashain. 

The ninth day is called 'Nawami'. The Taleju temple at

Hanuman Dhoka is opened for the public only once a year on

this day. Thousands of people go and pay their respect to the

goddess day. Temples of mother goddess are filled with people

from dawn till dusk. On this day the official military

sacrifices are held in the 'Kot' courtyard at Hanuman Dhoka.

The government allows foreigners to witness this function so

hundreds of tourists and diplomats eagerly gather here.

Animals mostly black buffaloes are slaughtered by hundreds to

honor Durga the goddess of victory and
 might and to seek her

blessing. Military bands play war tunes, guns boom and

officers with beautifully decorated medals in
 full uniform

stand there. When the function ends the courtyard is filled

ankle deep with blood. On this very day the god 
Vishwas

Karma, the God of creativity is also worshiped. All

factories, vehicles, any machinery instruments and anything


from which we make a living are worshiped. We also give

sacrifices to all moving machinery like cars, airplanes,

trucks
 etc. to get the blessing from goddess Durga for

protection for vehicles and their occupants against accidents

during the
 year. The entire day is colorful.<br><br> This year, Nawami and Vijaya Dashain Day falls on the same day.</p>

<br>


<p align="justify"><b>10th Dashain Day - Vijaya Dashain</b>: The tenth day is the 'Dashami'. On this

day we take tika
 and jamara from our elders and receive their

blessing. We visit our elders in their home and get tika from

them while 
our younger ones come to our home to receive

blessing from us. The importance of Dasain also lies in the

fact that on
 this day family members from far off and distant

relatives come for a visit as well as to receive tika from

the head of the
 family. This function continues for four

days. His Majesty also receives tika from the royal priests

and then gives on tika to 
his loyal subjects. Thousands of

loyal Nepalese people as well as foreigners also receive tika

from His Majesty the King as 
this is said to be auspicious.

After four days of rushing around and meeting your relatives

Dashain ends on the full moon day,
 the fifteenth day. In the

last day people stay at home and rest. The full moon day is

also called 'Kojagrata' meaning 'who is
 awake'. The Hindu

goddess of wealth Laxmi is worshiped. On this day the

goddess Laxmi is given an invitation to visit each
 and

everyone. After Dashain the nation settles back to normal. After

receiving the blessing of goddess Durga, people are
 ready to

work and acquire virtue, power and wealth. Dashain thus is

not only the longest festival but also the most anticipated



one among all the festivals of Nepal.</p>
