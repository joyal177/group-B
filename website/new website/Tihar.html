lesson! Early in the morning of the first day of Tihar, family prepares a good meal. Each member of the family takes the first portion of the meal outside on a platter.

The crows come down in large numbers and partake of the feast, they will call others before beginning to eat : Share, 

Share what you have with all! Crows (Kag in Nepali) are considered as the messenger of the Lord of Death, Yama. 

There is a popular Nepali superstition of crows too: When the crows caw, sadness is coming.) On this day crows are worshiped and are kept happy. Where there are no crows, any winged animal of the heavens (bird) will enjoy the feast. So Tihar is also about appreciating animals around us.<p></p>

Kukur (Dogs) are adorned with flower garland around their necks, red tika on their forehead, and are offered great meals, they are the king of the day!

On this day, people pray to the Kukur to guard their homes.  

Call someone "Kukur", he/she will bash you instantly! There are lots of Kukur running around in search of a loving home.

You can find them on streets and in your backyards, but on this day, even the most unsightly Kukkur will be treated like a king, everyone has a day.  

Tihar is also about breaking the boundaries only men created, "The Good", "The Bad", "The Ugly", and all but same to the mother nature! In Hinduism it is believed that Kukur guard's the underworld empire just like it guards our everyday homes!. Tihar is about loving Kukurs too!<p></p>

According to Hinduism, the human infant is fed breast milk by its human mother for

under three years. After weaning, the cow acts as the surrogate mother providing milk for the rest of the human life - through childhood, adult age and old age.

Cows are the mothers of the universe, the sacred animal. The cow puja is performed by giving a tika to a cow on her forehead, and a flower garland (Flower Leis) on the neck, 

and offering good meals. Those performing Cow puja place her manure in different parts of the home, drink a drop or two of the cow's urine, as a part of a purification process. 

Also dip a blade of grass into the urine and lightly sprinkle it on each other's body to become closer to the mother of the universe - cow.

<td><p align="justify"><b>Tihar Day 5 - Bhai Tika</b> : On the final day also known as Bhai Tika Day, sisters give tika (a colored powder placed on once's forehead), and mala 

(a necklace of flowers or also known as as flower leis, similar to that's used elsewhere like in Hawaii!)

to brothers along with wishes for long life and prosperity.</p>



<p align="justify"> To sisters, Tihar is also the time to re-call their continued 

wish for a long and a happy life for their brothers. Brothers sit on a floor while sisters perform their puja. Puja involves following 

a traditional ritual in which sisters circle brothers three times dripping oil on the floor from a copper pitcher. Afterwards, sisters put oil in brother's ears and hairs, then give Tika. 

Also breaking of walnuts by sisters prior to giving Tika to brothers is also a common practice. 

Tika starts with placing a banana leave already cut into a line shape placed on brothers forehead held by one of the sisters hand, then applying tika base (made from rice paste) in the open space. Then sister dabs seven colors on top of the base using her fingers. Some may give tika with the help of a small stick or a brush without the using banana leaves. In this case, small stick is dipped into the tika base, then brushed vertically on the forehead, then using a different stick, the seven colors are applied on top of the base. After tika, flower garland is put around brother's neck. Then brothers give tika to sisters in the same fashion. Sisters also receive flower garland around their neck.    

Brothers give gifts such as clothes or money to sisters while sisters give a special gift known as Sagun (which is made of dried fruits and nuts, and candies), and a fantastic Tihar feast takes place.

Those without a sister or brother, join relatives or friends for tika. Sisters pray for their brother's long life to the Hindu God of Death (Yam Raj).</p>
